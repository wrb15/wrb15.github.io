I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to marine conservation and fisheries management through my work as a Research Technician at [Duke University Marine Lab](https://sites.nicholas.duke.edu/silliman/portfolio/willa-brooks/) in Dr. Brian Sillimans Lab. 

I graduated from the [Duke University](https://nicholas.duke.edu/programs/masters) with a Master of Environmental Management (MEM) and a certificate in Geospatial Analysis in 2019.

My resume is available [here](files/Brooks_W_Resume_July2019.pdf).
